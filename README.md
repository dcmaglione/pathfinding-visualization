# pathfinding-visualization
Visualizations of various pathfinding algorithms, such as A* and Dijkstra's. Created using Python and Pygame modules.

## Description
Pathfinding or pathing is the plotting, by a computer application, of the shortest route between two points. This Python program visualizes this process using A* and Dijkstra's Algorithm.

## Installation
This pathfinding visualizer uses Pygame modules. To install Pygame run the following in the project directory:

```
pip install pygame
```

## Controls
### Left-Click: 
* First Click: Places starting node on grid.
* Second Click: Places ending node on grid.
* Following Clicks: Places barriers anywhere on the grid.
Please note, if the starting or end node is revealed, the following click will place another.

### Right-Click:
Erases nodes, hold down and hover over location on grid to erase.

### Space:
Starts the visulization.

### r-Key:
Clears or resets visualization program.

## Contributing
These programs are open to contribution, as I am continuously learning and attempting to improve my skills using Python.
